## Biography
I’m a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science and Technology in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Before my Ph.D. career, I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology in June 2016 from University of Science and Technology of China.

In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree without entrance examination.

## Research Interests
My research interests include: Social Network Mining and Deep Learning. Currently, I’m focused on social network related tasks:
-   Network Embedding;
-   Network Alignment;
-   Node Classification;

## Experience
### _Social Network Mining_
> Worked on network alignment problem according to topology structure.
- Studied the interpretability in embedding-based network alignment methods
- Developed a representation learning method to jointly align multiple networks.
> Worked on designing graph neural network for vertex classification.
- Assisted in developing a graph convolutional gate for collective classification in heterogeneous networks.

### _Network Embedding_
> Worked on learning node representations of social networks.
- Proposed a method that addresses the noise problem in multiplex network embedding.

### _Trajectory Data Mining_
> Worked on trajectory clusterin.
- Took part in an anomaly detection system for moinitoring the trajectories and report unusual behaviors.

### _Short Text Analysis Project_
> Worked on improving the accuracy for short text classification.
